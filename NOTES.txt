TODO:

- let growth decision net choose tube length (0 - max length), length proportional to growth cost
- find out how to stop gen_alg process

- make growth angle relative to average direction of existing tubes, not absolute

- let growth decision net change its dims (possible?)
- growth cost based on tube length (because tubes do not reach their max size if they collide)
- find good place for createRandomizedFoodSources function
- how to deal with multiple collisions at one growth step?
