TODO:

- choose a smart way to initialize net weights

- let growth decision net choose tube length (0 - max length), length proportional to growth cost

- let growth decision net change its dims (possible?)
- growth cost based on tube length (because tubes do not reach their max size if they collide)
- find good place for createRandomizedFoodSources function
- how to deal with multiple collisions at one growth step?

Animation:
- fix yellow screen at the last step
- drag and drop, to move view around
- show object info on hover
